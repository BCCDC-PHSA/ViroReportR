**authors list and order not finalized**

*Your paper must include the following required sections:*
**Summary**: A description of the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience.

**Statement of need**: A section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software and places it in the context of related work. This should clearly state what problems the software is designed to solve, who the target audience is, and its relation to other work.

**State of the field**: A description of how this software compares to other commonly-used packages in the research area. If related tools exist, provide a clear “build vs. contribute” justification explaining your unique scholarly contribution and why existing alternatives are insufficient.

**Software design**: An explanation of the trade-offs you weighed, the design/architecture you chose, and why it matters for your research application. This should demonstrate meaningful design thinking beyond a superficial code structure description.

**Research impact statement**: Evidence of realized impact (publications, external use, integrations) or credible near-term significance (benchmarks, reproducible materials, community-readiness signals). The evidence should be compelling and specific, not aspirational.

**AI usage disclosure**: Transparent disclosure of any use of generative AI in the software creation, documentation, or paper authoring. If no AI tools were used, state this explicitly. If AI tools were used, describe how they were used and how the quality and correctness of AI-generated content was verified.*

# Summary

Viral respiratory infections have established community transmission happening yearround
or in seasonal patterns. Forecasting tools are essential for efficient surveillance
and effective public health policy development. This package was built to support BC
public health decision makers and surveillance teams by providing them with the latest
forecast of the number of viral respiratory infections for common virus, such as Sars-
CoV-2, Influenza A and Respiratory Syncytial Virus. Given how widespread is these
virus, and the Covid-19 pandemic, we decided to upload this package to CRAN and
release the methodology publicaly. This R package provides an automated short-term
forecasting and report generation of viral respiratory infections. Using Cori et al.’s Rt
estimation methods [@coriNewFrameworkSoftware2013] , it provides real-time
projections across different time horizons and disease types.
