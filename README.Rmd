The goal of `vriforecasting` is to ...

## Installation

`vriforecasting` depends on the latest version of the `EpiEstim` package (2.4). Thus, this version must be installed from GitHub prior to installing the `vriforecasting` package using: 

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
install.packages('EpiEstim', repos = c('https://mrc-ide.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```


You can then install the development version of `vriforecasting` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r

devtools::install_github("sempwn/vriforecasting")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(vriforecasting)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.

## Work flow

Try and use the following steps when working on features/issues and fixing bugs (see this [tutorial](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) for using `git`):

* First run `git pull` to get the latest version of `master`
* Whenever possible, when working on a new feature or a bug make sure there is a corresponding issue open for it within Github. If it doesn't exist then feel free to make one yourself.
* Create a new branch with a name related to the feature being worked on and then switch to it e.g. `git checkout -b feature_make_better_model`
* When working on the feature branch try and commit as often as possible and include references to the issue number being worked on e.g. `git commit -m "Re #42. Found answer to life, universe and everything."`
* Once feature is written or bug is fixed consider writing a test for it (see [tests](#tests) section for more details). Then run `pytest` in the console to check everything passes. If using a `conda` environment, first activate the environment and then run `python -m pytest`. If a test fails, try and resolve issue and re-run tests until everything passes.
* Once happy with the feature push the branch to Github by running a `git push` on the feature branch e.g. `git push origin feature_make_better_model`
* In Github create a pull request for the feature and assign a reviewer. Anyone else can review the code, choose whoever you think would be best to look over it.
* If the changes were substantial, document the changes along with a rationale on the [google document](#).
* As a reviewer, check the changes by performing a `git pull` on the branch. Check the differences and run the feature yourself. If satisfied, then perform the merge on Github referencing the issue.
    *  If a merge conflict arises, then the reviewer can try to resolve or pass it back to the feature creator to resolve.
