The goal of `ViroReportR` is to provide a toolbox to conveniently generate short-term forecasts (with accompanied diagnostics) for viral respiratory diseases.

## Installation

`ViroReportR` depends on the latest version of the `EpiEstim` package (2.4). Thus, this version of the package must be installed from GitHub prior to installing the `ViroReportR` package using: 

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
install.packages('EpiEstim', repos = c('https://mrc-ide.r-universe.dev', 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
```


You can then install the development version of `ViroReportR` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r

devtools::install_github("BCCDC-PHSA/ViroReportR")
```

## Quick Start

`ViroReportR` can be used to generate short-term forecasts with accompanied diagnostics in a few lines of code. We go through an example here where the `EpiEstim` backend is used to generate forecasts of Influenza-A.

```{r example}
library(ViroReportR)
```

We will use the PLOVER weekly data for Influenza A, which is included with the `ViroReportR` package. We then use the `get_weekly_plover` and `get_weekly_plover_by_date_type` functions to transform the PLOVER data into a dataset with two columns: `date` and `confirm` in accordance to format accepted by the model fitting functions. 

```{r }
disease_type <- "flu_a"
weekly_plover_date_type <- get_weekly_plover_by_date_type(
  plover_data = plover_data,
  type = disease_type,
  start_date = "2022-10-01",
  end_date = "2022-12-01")

head(weekly_plover_date_type)
```

## Model fitting and forecasting over sliding windows 

The `forecast_time_period_epiestim` can be used to produce both daily and weekly forecasts using weekly sliding windows. For this example, we produce forecasts using `EpiEstim` as the backend algorithm choice. The other current choice for the forecasting algorithm is `EpiFilter` (WIP).

We can produce forecasts aggregated by week by setting `time_period = weekly`. For the functionality, `n_days` must be a multiple of 7. Thus, specifying `n_days = 14` when `time_period = weekly` produces 14/7 i.e. 2-week ahead forecasts. 

```{r message = FALSE}
time_period_result_weekly <- forecast_time_period(data = weekly_plover_date_type, 
start_date = "2022-10-02", n_days = 14, type = "flu_a", time_period = "weekly" , algorithm = "EpiEstim")
```

Finally, we can plot a validation plot using the `plot_validation` function. We can plot 2 week ahead forecasts for example by setting the `pred_horizon` argument. 

```{r , dpi = 300, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5, out.width= '80%'}
plot_validation(time_period_result_weekly, pred_horizon_str = "2 week ahead", pred_plot = "ribbon")
```

The object of class `forecast_time_period` produced by the `forecast_time_period` function also has a customized `summary` function. This function checks to see if the weekly data inputted fall into the ranges of the prediction quantiles and issues a warning if this is not the case. This can be a useful check to assess the forecasts produced and the model fit along with the validation plot. It takes in the same arguments as the `plot_validation` function above:

```{r}
summary(time_period_result_weekly, pred_horizon_str = "2 week ahead")
```

Finally, the `ViroReportR` package can conveniently generate an automated report for the current season for all supported viral respiratory diseases (Influenza-A, Influenza-B, RSV and SARS-CoV2) using the `generate_forecast_report` function, which renders an HTML report.

```{r eval = FALSE}
generate_forecast_report(output_dir = "PATH OF DIRECTORY")
```


## Work flow

Try and use the following steps when working on features/issues and fixing bugs (see this [tutorial](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/) for using `git`):

* First run `git pull` to get the latest version of `master`
* Whenever possible, when working on a new feature or a bug make sure there is a corresponding issue open for it within Github. If it doesn't exist then feel free to make one yourself.
* Create a new branch with a name related to the feature being worked on and then switch to it e.g. `git checkout -b feature_make_better_model`
* When working on the feature branch try and commit as often as possible and include references to the issue number being worked on e.g. `git commit -m "Re #42. Found answer to life, universe and everything."`
* Once feature is written or bug is fixed consider writing a test for it (see [tests](#tests) section for more details). Then run `pytest` in the console to check everything passes. If using a `conda` environment, first activate the environment and then run `python -m pytest`. If a test fails, try and resolve issue and re-run tests until everything passes.
* Once happy with the feature push the branch to Github by running a `git push` on the feature branch e.g. `git push origin feature_make_better_model`
* In Github create a pull request for the feature and assign a reviewer. Anyone else can review the code, choose whoever you think would be best to look over it.
* If the changes were substantial, document the changes along with a rationale on the [google document](#).
* As a reviewer, check the changes by performing a `git pull` on the branch. Check the differences and run the feature yourself. If satisfied, then perform the merge on Github referencing the issue.
    *  If a merge conflict arises, then the reviewer can try to resolve or pass it back to the feature creator to resolve.
